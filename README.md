**Spring JPA Test Assignment**

I believe my assignment will be completed by **Friday, 13th of October**. I need total 11 hrs to complete the assignment work. 
After the current analysis of the code, there are few pending issues as listed below, so I'm increasing the time required to complete the assignment:
1> CRUD operations and functionality are not working after the changes in the DAO.
2> Web-flow in the controller needs to be corrected for redirection.
3> Logging functionality needs to be implemented.
4> End to end testing of the application.
